# Track-My-Bus
The project "Track My Bus" is an embedded system. It can be used to track the location of a bus. The SIM808 GPS, GPRS, GSM module is inside the embedded device. The passengers can use the Track My Bus web application to enter the route number which they are going to use and see the buses which are traveling on that particular road.
